ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
You are required to design a high-level Terraform implementation to achieve the following:

1.Create an Azure Kubernetes Cluster:
  1. Design a Terraform configuration to provision an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
  2. Ensure the cluster is scalable and resilient.



2.Create Different Node Pools for Products:
  1. Implement Terraform code to create multiple node pools within the AKS cluster.

3.Prepare a Simple Web Application Kubernetes Resource Template:
  1. Design a Kubernetes resource template for deploying a simple web application.
  2. Ensure the application is accessible from the internet.
  3. Incorporate security compliance measures in the design.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS
• Scalability: Ensure the infrastructure can handle increased load and scale efficiently.
• Robustness: Design the infrastructure to be reliable and capable of handling failures.
• Resilience: Implement strategies to recover from disruptions and maintain service continuity.
• Security Compliance: Incorporate security best practices to protect resources and data.
